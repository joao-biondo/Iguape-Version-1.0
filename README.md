# Iguape - Paineira Graphical User Interface


## Description
Iguape is a graphical user interface designed to help users during *in situ* experiments at Paineira. Via Iguape the user can visualize the numerous XRD patterns generated throughout the experiments, and furthermore, the program allows for peak fitting at a selected angle interval.  

## Visuals

## Installation

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Any enquiries can be adressed to joao.neto@lnls.br. Please, fell free to suggest or correct anything.
