Iguape (Interface Gráfica para Usuários da Paineira - Paineira Graphical User Interface) is designed to be a complementary tool for in situ powder diffraction experiments, performed at the Paineira beamline (CNPEM/LNLS). The software allows for real-time visualization of XRD patterns and data processing of diffraction peaks.
