# Iguape - Paineira Graphical User Interface


## Description
Iguape is a graphical user interface designed to help users during *in situ* experiments at Paineira. Via Iguape the user can visualize the numerous XRD patterns generated throughout the experiments. The program allows for peak fitting at a selected angle interval.  

## Visuals
The GUI has two tabs and concentrate its features in a button panel at the bottom of the window. The XRD Data tab displays the diffraction patterns stacked by a user-defined offset. The Peak Fitting tab displays the data obtained through peak fitting of the XRD patterns on the selected 2theta interval.

## Installation
#Windows
For Windows users we make available a installer, which can be found at this repository
#Linux
We're still evaluating the availability of installation vai Linux-terminal.
## Usage
The first step, once Iguape is initialized, is to select a folder to monitor. This can be done by clicking in the **Folder** option at the upper right corner of the window. It's important that the selected folder contains the iguape_fileslist.txt file. It is though this text document, that Iguape can read the XRD data available at the Folder.
